#Robot-Warehouse

###Work-in-progress

Using TDD, the Jasmine testing framework and NodeJS.

A robot can move around a warehouse and pick up crates.


###Usage

At present there is no GUI so run the code via the Node REPL or the Chrome console.

More usage instructions coming soon.
 

###Testing

Install NodeJS and NPM.

Install the Jasmine module from npm:

```npm install -g jasmine```

Tests are written using Jasmine 2.4. Once the above dependencies are installed, you can run the tests using the ```jasmine``` command from the root directory via the command line.
